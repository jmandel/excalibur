# Journal

## 2026-06-27

- Created new git repo: `/home/exedev/kindle-wasm-converter`.
- Added calibre as submodule at `third_party/calibre` from `https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre.git`.
- Started `plan.md` with the Pyodide/reduced-calibre strategy.
- Started this chronological journal.
- Launched subagent `sample-fixtures` to find legally usable test EPUB/MOBI/AZW3 materials and fixture categories.

Initial calibre source observations from prior reconnaissance:

- Current calibre submodule HEAD is expected near `7f4ea78` from 2026-06-27.
- `AZW3Output.convert()` delegates to `create_kf8_book()` in `mobi/writer8/main.py`.
- The KF8 writer is compact enough to port later, but Pyodide reuse is the fastest proof-of-life.
- Likely shims needed: `calibre_extensions.icu`, `speedup`, `cPalmdoc`, `imageops`, `translator`.
- Start with EPUB input. MOBI reader adds more surface area but is mostly Python plus PalmDOC/HuffCDIC decompression.
